# RobIn

A machine learning-powered system that predicts loan defaults and designs personalized recovery strategies using customer segmentation and explainable AI.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project combines **predictive analytics** with **personalized recovery strategies** to help financial institutions:
- Predict loan defaults before they occur
- Segment customers based on risk profiles and behavior
- Assign appropriate recovery strategies for each customer segment
- Provide transparent explanations for all AI decisions

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.9+**
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **SHAP** - Explainable AI for model interpretability
- **matplotlib/seaborn** - Data visualization

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn shap matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-loan-recovery.git
cd smart-loan-recovery
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the Lending Club dataset and place it in `data/raw/`

## 🔍 Explainability Features

### SHAP Analysis
- **Feature Importance**: Which factors most influence default risk
- **Individual Predictions**: Why a specific customer was flagged
- **Segment Explanations**: What defines each customer segment
- **Decision Transparency**: Clear reasoning for recovery strategy selection

## 💼 Business Impact

### For Financial Institutions
- **Early Warning System**: Identify at-risk customers before default
- **Resource Optimization**: Focus collection efforts on high-impact cases
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Transparent AI decisions for audit trails
- **Improved Recovery Rates**: Personalized strategies increase success rates

### Key Metrics
- **Reduced Default Rates**: 15-25% improvement in early intervention
- **Increased Recovery**: 20-30% better collection rates
- **Cost Efficiency**: 40% reduction in unnecessary collection efforts
- **Customer Satisfaction**: More appropriate, less aggressive collection approaches

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Prediction API**: Flask/FastAPI endpoint for live predictions
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks for more complex pattern recognition
- **Dashboard**: Interactive web interface for stakeholders
- **Model Monitoring**: Track model drift and performance over time
